		🦋 Hello! 🦋
	</p></center>
	<p>
		I'm a <b>Senior Software Engineer</b> with my heart and mind focused on <b>data</b>. My journey is guided by the belief that technology, when applied thoughtfully, has the power to turn information into real-world impact.
	</p>
	<p>
		Professionally, I've built my career at the intersection of <b>software engineering</b> and <b>data engineering</b>. My specialty lies in designing and implementing <b>Big Data, Data Pipelines, and API solutions</b> that not only process information at scale but also create bridges between teams and knowledge domains.
	<p>
		I've worked with languages like <b>Go</b> and <b>Scala</b>, have <b>Python</b> as my tool of choice, and currently navigate projects with <b>Ruby</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>. My background includes a <b>Bachelor's in Computer Science</b>, a technical degree in Software Development, and I'm currently pursuing an <b>MBA in Full Cycle Architecture</b>, a path that reflects my constant desire to understand the complete lifecycle of the systems I build.
	</p>
	<p>
		But for me, technology goes beyond code. I deeply believe that access to knowledge is an agent of social change. This conviction led me to <b>co-found PyLadies Teresina in 2016</b>, a chapter dedicated to including and empowering women in the Python community. Since then, my active participation in Python Brasil, my role as <b>Big Kahuna at Python Nordeste 2025</b>, and my mentorship work have been ways to give back and strengthen the community that welcomed me. Seeing more women grow and lead in tech is one of my greatest motivations.
	</p>
	<p>
		Outside the digital universe, my life is marked by learnings that require focus and overcoming challenges. <b>I am a type 1 diabetic</b>, a condition that daily teaches me about discipline, care, and resilience. I find freedom and strength in <b>pole dance</b>, and I recently embarked on the adventure of learning roller skating. These are activities that, in different ways, connect me with my body and remind me that growth comes with practice and courage.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whether to discuss data, architecture, collaborate on impactful projects, or simply exchange ideas about tech communities and inclusion, feel free to get in touch. <b>Let's build amazing things together!</b> 🦋
