This is my twelfth week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: “[Week 11 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapaulamendes.github.io/week-11-100-days-of-code/)” .

Day 78 - I improved the algorithm to simulate a ribosome by inserting an activator for processing. And I read "Class-based views".

Day 79 - I improved a line of ribosome code with the suggestion of [@**gmonnerat**](https://twitter.com/gmonnerat). I implemented a search engine and tags in the [@**colaboradados**](https://twitter.com/colaboradados) and I improved my website separating my posts by idiom and I put a more beautiful color.

Day 80 - I fixed the responsive CSS of my blog and I implemented a blog on the site of [@**colaboradados**](https://twitter.com/colaboradados). I did a Software Engineering homework of University from which I had to do Jekyll, Django, Django Rest Framework, Docker, Axios and PostgreSQL installation tutorial. I made a tutorial to create an API with Django Rest Framework and I implemented the code very simple.

Day 81 - I improved the ribosome code and I studied Growth Rate of Functions and the Complexity of Algorithms.

Day 82 - I learned how to install a VPN.

Day 83 - I learned good practices of git with [@**gmonnerat**](https://twitter.com/gmonnerat) hehehe. And I studied Pipeline of Computer Architecture.

Day 84 - I read about the MVC Architecture.
