I decided to do the challenge 100 days of code to create a coding study routine that I planned and I can improve my skills. I love computing and I believe that the #100DaysOfCode challenge will help me become a better programmer!

This was my first week attending the 100 days of code challenge. The biggest challenge in the first week was to choose and organize the contents to study as you define routine of study and coding.

So for the first week I chose to meet my needs first. So I started the challenge by organizing and refactoring my blog and listing its next issues for me to solve. There are already many problems to solve the blog, so at first I've been able to list more things to do on other days of the challenge.

On the second day I helped my friend, [Lucas Hiago](https://twitter.com/luchiago), with a Django REST Framework project. We learned a lot together! After helping him, I did a tutorial to learn how to make a bot for Telegram with Python and API. While I did the tutorial I had the idea of ​​later building a Telegram bot that gets FreeCodeCamp articles that are released on Twitter, because I love their content. For this I will need to learn about the Twitter API. So I already have two more activities for the next days and weeks of the challenge.

On the third day I did the complete Django Rest Framework documentation tutorial to review, I was able to learn more things I didn't understand before.

On the fourth and fifth day I did the 'Writing your first Django app' tutorial from the django documentation. I also did with the intention of reviewing and learning concepts that I didn't understand before.

On the sixth day I read the two supplementary articles in the Django documentation tutorial: "Advanced tutorial: How to write reusable apps" and "What to read next" which is a documentation guide. I also read PEP 20 from Python that talks about The Zen of Python because I love Python and its philosophy.

On the seventh day I read two articles from the blog [Simple Is Better Than Complex](https://t.co/gYI22KBZ4k) about redirect and humanize. Then I read about them in the Django documentation.

I'm sorry if my article has grammatical errors in English, this isn't my first language and I'm taking the challenge to improve this skill as well.

I hope that sharing my advances during the challenge help and motivate others as well. If you want to start and you're scared, do it even you're scared! If you want, you can contact me to ask questions or send constructive criticism. Remember that not all criticisms are constructive, if they aren't, keep it to yourself.
