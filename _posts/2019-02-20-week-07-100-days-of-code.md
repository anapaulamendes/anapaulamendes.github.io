This is my seventh week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. And I completed 50 days of the 100 days of code, so I'm halfway through the challenge and I've learned a lot.

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: “[Week 06 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapaulamendes.github.io/week-06-100-days-of-code/)” .

Day 43 - I read about 'Django CKEditor'.

Day 44 - I read: "Useful Tips to help you create good habits as a web developer", "Custom Manager with Chainable QuerySets", "Disabling Migrations to Speed ​​Up Unit Tests", "Using F () Expressions", "Using the Messages Framework ".

Day 45 - I read: "Using Mixins With Class-Based Views", "Simple Database Access Optimizations", "Using QuerySet Latest & Earliest Methods" and "Difference Between ugettext And ugettext_lazy".

Day 46 - I read: "Protecting Sensitive Information", "Working With Multiple Settings Modules", "Using The Redirects App" and "Designing Better Models". So I finished reading all the Django Tips from the blog Simple is Better Than Complex.

Day 47 - I studied a little of git rebase.

Day 48 - I studied a little of flake8, coding style, docstrings, and git rebase.

Day 49 - I learned a bit about the moment.js of JavaScript.
