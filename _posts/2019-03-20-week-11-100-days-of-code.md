This is my eleventh week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: “[Week 10 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapaulamendes.github.io/week-10-100-days-of-code/)” .

Day 71 - I tried to understand how assertRaises works in unit tests.

Day 72 - I read "50 tips to maintain a Django reusable app".

Day 73 - I read "An Introduction to Test-Driven Development".

Day 74 - I studied Non-Deterministic Finite Automata, Non-deterministic Finite Automata with λ moves and Transforming a Non-Deterministic Finite State Automata Into a Deterministic One. I read too: "Uma Introdução a Cálculo Lambda" and "How to work in Data Science, AI, or Big Data based on my experience".

Day 75 - I read "Bioinformatics in China: A Personal Perspective" and "How to check if an input is empty with CSS".

Day 76 - I studied User authentication in Django.

Day 77 - I did an algorithm to simulate a ribosome, from which you give an RNA in the input and it generates the chain of amino acids. And I read the article "Resurrecting ancient animal genomes: the extinct moa and more".
