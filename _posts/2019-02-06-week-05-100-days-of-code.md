This is my fifth week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. This week I read a lot and doing this post I paid attention that, but I have being very tired too. It's really challenging to keep up the pace on #100DaysOfCode.

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: "[Week 04 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapaulamendes.github.io/week-04-100-days-of-code/)" .

Day 29 - I studied Git in more depth. A bit of good practice with Git too.

Day 30 -  I only coded at work, and I read this article: "How to manage stress - a dev's guide". It was a busy week and I was very tired.

Day 31 - I closed a issue of [Colaboradados](https://github.com/colaboradados/colaboradados.github.io) creating a new section for the podcast. I also did my 'Her Voice' English tasks. And finally, I read about 'Filtering' of Django Rest Framework.

Day 32 - I studied focusing on Axios. And I read 'How to Use RESTful APIs with Django'

Day 33 - I fixed the code indentation of [Colaboradados](https://github.com/colaboradados/colaboradados.github.io), I rewritten the md files with the correct markdown syntax and I deleted files and CSS that weren't being used. I also read about 'Status Codes' from the Django Rest Framework.

Day 34 - I have reviewed some PRs of the [Colaboradados](https://github.com/colaboradados/colaboradados.github.io) and I was making the slides of a workshop that I'll be teaching Python programming for distance learning teachers from the University I study.

Day 35 - I studied Tuples of Python and read these two articles: 'To Ruby From Python' and 'PEP 351 - The Freeze Protocol' which was rejected.
