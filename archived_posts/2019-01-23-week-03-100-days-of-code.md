This is my third week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge. It was a week that I directed my studies to the needs of my job.

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: "[Week 02 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapaulamendes.github.io/week-02-100-days-of-code/)" .

Day 15 - I made statistical exercises about Mean, Median, Mode and mid-range, Frequency tables and Mean from frequency tables. I'm attending Winter of Data to learn Data Science.

Day 16 - I read 3 Django Tips from the blog "Simple is Better than Complex". I read the "Automatic DateTime Fields", "How to Merge QuerySets" and "get_or_create".

Day 17 - I read about 'Reading and Writing CSV Files in Python' and made some codes. I needed to apply that subject to finalize a freelance.

Day 18 - I studied some more about pandas and finished the freelance. I prepared a Python installation guide for various operating systems for a Python course I'm gonna teach. I was really tired!

Day 19 - I learned a little about SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

Day 20 - I continued to study about SEO. I needed to apply in my internship and I will take the knowledge to apply in my personal blog. It is an area that has left me very enchanted, I wonder the complexity of the search algorithms.

Day 21 - I studied how to write custom django-admin commands. In recent days I have directed my studies to the needs of my work.
