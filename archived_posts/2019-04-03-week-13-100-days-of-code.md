This is my thirteenth week doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge.

If you want to read about what I did last week, see here: “[Week 12 - 100 Days of Code](https://anapaulamendes.github.io/week-12-100-days-of-code/)” .

Day 85 - I learned the Smith-Waterman algorithm. This algorithm performs local and global sequence alignment.

Day 86 - I read about the Skyline Problem.

Day 87 - I read about Floating Point Math.

Day 88 - I studied on Single Cycle, Multiple Cycle, and Pipeline to Computer Architecture and Organization. And I read about the RNA splicing and I implemented the algorithm.

Day 89 - I learned a little about preventDefault() and I done university homeworks.

Day 90 - I read about Skyline Problem again.

Day 91 - I studied Algorithm Analysis, Function Growth, Division and Conquer.
